# A writer, a code writer though.
## A short presentation
I'm a college student, studying a degree related to the field of Computer Engineering and Computer/Data Science. More precisely:

[Grado en Ingenier√≠a Inform√°tica, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain](https://informatica.ucm.es/estudios/grado-ingenieriainformatica-estudios)

I'm starting to specialize in **Artificial Intelligence**, not only because its the current trend or the possibility of getting a lucrative job, but because of the opportunity of participating in any multidisciplinary research.

People have different aspirations for what they want their profession to be; bigger or smaller aspirantions, but promises to themselves, nonetheless. One of mine consists in contributing as a researcher in **Computational Neuroscience**, but thats a goal really far away from from where I am.

There's also a particular thing I really like about all this idea of the Open Source Knowledge. If I had the option, I prefer not to teach. Although, I really like making great notes and writing usefull resources for students to use (for free, of course). GitHub grant students of my university a place to share notes, code, solved exercise and even frameworks to work on projects of particular subjects.

I think that's the very best first open source proyect any student can start: **sharing knowledge to others for the sake of it**. An online help compendia available anywhere, at anytime.

At least I rather think that, because being lost in this network of projects and contribuiting by making small edits on text files is sometimes oddly demoralizing.
## Programming and Design Languages I have worked with
- `C++` (even OOP)
- `Java` (OOP) (Swing)
- `VHDL` in really small Vivado projects for FPGA's
- `ARM` as tool for understanding how Assembly Code works
- `C` oriented as Assembly Code for Texas Instruments CPU in order to undestand how interruptions works
- `UML 2.X`
## Current proyects I'm working on
- Uploading solved exercises of the subject FAL.
